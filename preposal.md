# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1) Visual story through renpy as I have never used that program before. 

2) Possibly something in pygame.

3) Something similar to a crypto defi game.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Alone

## Do you have any questions of your own?

I would be very open to suggestions as I am not sure which direction to go at all.

Not at the moment otherwise. I will be sure to ask as soon as I have any.
